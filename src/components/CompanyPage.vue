                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>ANGA Hub was born from the shared vision of two passionate computer science students. Fueled by a desire to solve complex problems and build impactful systems, their mission was clear: to develop technology that would unite and uplift the African continent. The name "ANGA" - Africa NextGen Apex - crystallizes this ambition, representing our dedication to placing Africa at the forefront of technological advancement and innovation.</p>
                <p>From late-night coding sessions and a relentless pursuit of excellence, what started as a student-led initiative has blossomed into a dynamic force for digital transformation. We are committed to leveraging cutting-edge solutions and strategic collaborations to address Africa's unique challenges and unlock its vast potential. Our journey is one of youthful ingenuity maturing into impactful, real-world solutions, always driven by a core belief in technology's power to foster a brighter future for the continent.</p>
